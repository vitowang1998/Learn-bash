echo

echo $0
-check which Unix Shell we are using now
-print [bash] if we are using bash
       [-bash] if we are using -bash



echo [GOLBBING PARTTERN]
-print the files in current directory that fits the [GOLBBING PARTTERN]
-note that if there exists no files that fit the [GOLBBING PARTTERN], echo prints [GOLBBING PARTTERN]
-hence we should not use echo to print the files that conform to a [GOLBBING PARTTERN], use "ls" instead.



echo $[variable]
-print the value of [variable] if [variable] is previously defined
